## Part 1: Creating and Using a Module

- Create a file named mymath.py containing:
- A function add(a, b) → returns the sum of two numbers.
- A function sub(a, b) → returns the difference of two numbers.
- A variable PI = 3.14.

In another file calculator.py:

Write a program called that imports sub as s and add from mymath.py.

It should ask the user to choose an operation (add or sub) and enter two numbers, then print the result.

```python
Choose operation (add/sub): add
Enter first number: 7
Enter second number: 5
Result = 12
```
